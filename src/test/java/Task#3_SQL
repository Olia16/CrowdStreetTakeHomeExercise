INSERT INTO people_vehicle(name,vehicle,number_of_vehicles) values ('Mary', 'Truck=1', 1);
INSERT INTO people_vehicle (name,vehicle,number_of_vehicles) values ('Chen', 'none', 0);

);

INSERT INTO people_pet (people_name,pet,number_of_pets) values ('John', 'Dog=1', 1);
INSERT INTO people_pet (people_name,pet,number_of_pets) values ('Mary', 'none', 0);
INSERT INTO people_pet (people_name,pet,number_of_pets) values ('Chen','Parrot=1, Cat=1', 2);

name vehicles pets
John Car=2, Truck=2 Dog=1
Mary Truck=1 None
Chen None Parrot=1, Cat=1

Solution:

select v.name,v.vehicle,p.pet
from people_vehicle v inner join people_pet p on v.name=p.people_name;
